Hello Axel (Atlasbalans AB),

We have successfully migrated the VMs to new vcloud platform.

You must received an email with token to create user in new platform. After creating the user you should be able to login to the new platform.
New vCloud platform link: https://vcloud1.cygate.io/tenant/AtlasbalansAB/

Note:
If you are still using our old platform (10.0.10.10 and 10.0.11.11) DNS Ips please change it our new DNS 193.108.1.50 for the VMs.
The old DNS servers will NOT be reachable on the new platform.

Please let us know everything is working fine or not

Best Regards,
Cygate AB
